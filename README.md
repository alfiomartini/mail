# Abstract

This application is a **front-end** for an email client that makes calls to an existing API written in **Django**. The API supports GET, POST and PUT requests to send, receive and get messages from a database. I extented the API to deal with DELETE requests as well. No actual messages are sent. The front-end is written with _HTML_, _CSS_, _Bootstrap_ and _JavaScript_. The entire application is just a single page, with JavaScript used to control de interface. The interface supports basic _registration_ and _authentication_ of users, display of _inbox_, _sent_ and _archived_ messages. _Read_ and _unread_ messages are displayed with a _gray_, respectively _white_, background. Inbox messages can be replied, (un)archived, deleted and marked as unread. You can see it live [here](https://client-email.herokuapp.com/).
